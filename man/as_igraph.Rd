\title{Convert a Molecule3D's bonds to an igraph graph}
\usage{
as_igraph(
  molecule,
  vertex_attrs = c("elena", "element", "x", "y", "z"),
  edge_attrs = c("bond_id", "bond_type"),
  include_isolated = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{molecule}{A \code{structures::Molecule3D} object.}

\item{vertex_attrs}{Character vector of atom columns to keep as vertex attributes.
The atom ID (\code{eleno}) is always included as \code{name}. Default:
\code{c("elena", "element", "x", "y", "z")}. Columns not present are ignored.}

\item{edge_attrs}{Character vector of bond columns to keep as edge attributes
(besides endpoints). Default: \code{c("bond_id", "bond_type")}. Columns not
present are ignored.}

\item{include_isolated}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default) include all atoms as
vertices even if they have no bonds.}
}
\value{
An undirected \pkg{igraph} graph. Vertex attribute \code{name} holds
the atom ID (\code{eleno}). Additional attributes may be present as requested.
}
\description{
Builds an undirected \pkg{igraph} graph from a \code{Molecule3D}'s bond table.
Vertices correspond to atoms (\code{atoms$eleno}); edges correspond to bonds
(\code{bonds$origin_atom_id} -- \code{bonds$target_atom_id}). When there are
no bonds, a vertex-only graph is returned (one vertex per atom).
}
\examples{
# g <- bonds_as_igraph(m)
# igraph::components(g)
