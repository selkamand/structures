\title{Filter molecule for specific atoms by name}
\usage{
filter_atoms_by_name(x, elena)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link{Molecule3D}} object.}

\item{elena}{Character vector of atom names to keep (matching
\code{x@atoms$elena}).}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{Molecule3D}} object containing only atoms whose
\code{elena} is in \code{elena}, and the bonds between them.
}
\description{
Filters a molecule to include only atoms whose \code{elena} (atom name) matches
one or more requested values. Orphaned bonds (i.e. bonds whose endpoints are
not both retained) are automatically dropped, in the same way as
\code{\link[=filter_atoms]{filter_atoms()}}.
}
\examples{
path <- system.file(package = "structures", "benzene.mol2")
molecule <- read_mol2(path)

# Keep only atoms whose name is "C"
molecule_C <- filter_atoms_by_name(molecule, elena = "C")

}
