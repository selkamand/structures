\title{Shape: a simple 3D polyhedral container}
\usage{
Shape(
  vertices = default_vertices(),
  edges = default_edges(),
  faces = list(),
  symmetry_elements = SymmetryElementCollection()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vertices}{A data.frame with columns \code{name} (character, unique),
\code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{z} (numeric) giving vertex coordinates.}

\item{edges}{A data.frame with columns \code{vertex1}, \code{vertex2} (character)
listing undirected edges by vertex name. May be empty.}

\item{faces}{A named list of character vectors, where each vector contains
vertex names that form a polygonal face. May be empty.}

\item{symmetry_axes}{An optional list of \code{\link{ProperRotationAxis}} objects describing known
symmetry axes. May be empty.}
}
\value{
A \code{Shape} S7 object.
}
\description{
\code{Shape} is a lightweight S7 class representing a polyhedral shape via a set of
vertices, edges, and faces. It is used by helpers such as \code{shape_tetrahedron()},
\code{shape_cube()}, \code{shape_octahedron()}, \code{shape_icosahedron()}, and
\code{shape_dodecahedron()} to construct common Platonic solids. The class enforces
basic validation for internal consistency (e.g. edges and faces must reference
known vertex names).

\examples{
# Create a custom shape with two vertices and one edge
v <- data.frame(
  name = c("A", "B"),
  x = c(0, 1),
  y = c(0, 0),
  z = c(0, 0),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
e <- data.frame(vertex1 = "A", vertex2 = "B", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
s <- Shape(vertices = v, edges = e, faces = list())
